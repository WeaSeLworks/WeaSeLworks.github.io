Battery life lasts years


 Emphasise how this is much better than existing tech. It has to be a major advance to get customers to shift from their existing tech.

Current technology used today to track livestock has remained virtually the same for decades. It has a range measured in centimetres and requires the farmer to be in close contact with the animal. We will leverage Internet of Things technology such as LoRaWAN which has battery life of years and ranges that can be measured in kilometres to allow live tracking the movement of livestock. This will provide new usecases not possible before such as realtime alerts, health insights and anti-theft potential.

HEALTH INSIGHTS
Early lameness detection enables focus on the animals that need attention.
Easy bulk/individual recording of disease & drugs administered.


Early detection is essential

Movement and temperature sensors are used to track and report behaviour in the field.
The system detects abnormal behaviour in individual
animals allowing early intervention.
Diseases such Scald, Footrot and CODD cost UK sheep farmers Â£90m in 2017.
Farm Hand can protect flock health by identifying lameness early.
